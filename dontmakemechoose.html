Like any modern academic institution, our school is guilty of departmentalising learning, separating out our arts and sciences. In contemporary history this is often the case; Science is the preserve of researchers and academics, while aesthetics are the retreat of artists and designers. What is interesting to consider is that the aims of both of these seemingly divergent activities are to explore and further our understanding of the world we inhabit. If it is truly the case that they strive towards the same ideal I question whether in our modern world the cavernous divide that currently separates them is really necessary. 
<br><br>
For me, Art has always helped my studies. I can never truly say I understand something fully unless I can draw a picture of it, transform it into something I find logical - something more tangible than a stream of academic explanations and technical language. My case is most certainly not a unique one. In fact it is one of the most common interactions between Science and Art that we try use diagrams and visuals to represent facts and data in more accessible forms but for many this type of interaction is simply the use of aesthetics to demonstrate science and only a stepping stone towards full on collaboration. 
<br><br>
However in this article I would like to explain a small bit about the emerging new field coming from the symbiosis of these traditionally contrasting subjects. In 1996 London's Wellcome Institute set up the ‘’sciart’’ funding program which began giving grants to experimental projects involving collaborations between artists and scientists exploring scientific subject matter through the arts. In these types of interactions it is obvious to see what an artist can gain; some of our most spectacular visuals and innovative machinery crucial in contemporary art were developed in scientific explorations. What is far more interesting to consider, and hopefully as time progresses will become more apparent, are the benefits that Science and the Scientific method can reap in return. It is in fact true that science now relies on many of the creative processes so crucial to good Art and Design, because of this these multidisciplinary projects actually serve to aid and stretch the ways in which we conduct and apply new research leading to widespread benefits. 
<br><br>
Above all other fields of enquiry these interactions have had their most profound effects on the field of neuroscience. An obvious example might be that of Synaesthesia. Synaesthesia occurs when neurological associations are made between different senses and sensations that for the majority of people are normally experienced separately; people with the condition may hear yellow or associate music to sounds. For those with Synaesthesia it links these responses intrinsically and affects every aspect of how they interact and process information. The studying of synaesthesia in conjunction with Art has been done by looking at the participants responses to interactions of colour and composition, contrasting the reactions of those with Synaesthesia and those without the condition has helped scientists to understand more about how the brain segregates different sensations; hopefully allowing us to treat and alleviate adverse side effects associated with various neurological conditions and continuing research should allow us to do this more effectively in the future. 
<br><br>
Design is notable for how it integrates the processes of both art and sciences. It translates those things we observe into material objects that we can use. Synthetic Biology is at the cutting edge of science and it is interesting to consider how it could be shaped by Design and the Arts. It is not an alien idea when we try to design life to solve our day to day problems. Since 1978 we have been using bacteria to produce human insulin. It is interesting to consider that soon we will reach a stage at which sciences venturing into synthetic biology will be design driven, creating tangible objects from biological processes. It will be the interaction between Biology and experimental design that will drive this innovative new field forward. 
<br><br>
I think it is important that we begin to deconstruct some of the barriers that lie between the creative Arts and the Sciences. If any of this has been of interest to you I would like to invite anyone to contact me about how to get involved in our project.
